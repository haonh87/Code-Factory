# Step 2 - Business Goal

> [!summary]
> Allow a reviewed admission proposal to continue without users deleting its folder or editing lifecycle JSON.

## Step Contract

```yaml
step_goal: "Make progress and preservation measurable."
input_summary: ["s01 defect reproduction"]
output_summary: ["One outcome with explicit non-goals"]
done_when: ["Success includes both authoring continuity and unchanged implementation authority"]
owner: po
```

## Main Artifact

```yaml
user_problem: "The current CLI traps persisted candidates and can replace the original dedup evidence on retry."
business_goal: "Recover eligible proposals through a documented command while keeping review evidence and gate authority intact."
success_metrics: ["Both eligible proposal shapes reach MATERIALIZED", "Zero lost original state/history", "Zero implicit approvals or grants", "One committed recovery per operation"]
non_goals: ["Improve similarity scoring", "Batch or automate human approvals", "Resolve CR-008 live state", "Publish a patch release"]
constraints: ["Existing local CLI and trusted approval mechanism", "One bounded repair owner"]
assumptions: ["Initial supported recovery is brownfield/single/no-change-package only."]
```

## Traceability

```yaml
upstream: ["materialization-dedup-recovery.s01.restate.md"]
next_step: "s03 Open Questions"
```

## Handoff

The outcome is technical repair plus verified handoff. Live maintenance and release remain separately owned.
